# Create a "choose your own adventure" style game using Ruby. Store characters as classes with unique attributes and methods. 
# Use methods and recursive methods to simplify the logical
# ï¬‚ow of the game and the gets method to get user input.
# Use this exercise to be sure you're familiar with advanced Ruby topics.
